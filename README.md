# IDC409_DS_Project

#### Our IDC409 (Intro to DS and ML) course project on Event Type Classification of Belle II detector data (High Energy Physics)

The dataset provided to us consisted of different features and different event types (uubar, ddbar, ssbar, ccbar and bbbar). Our goal was to train a model using different features
available from the Belle II detector and try to reduce the features.
